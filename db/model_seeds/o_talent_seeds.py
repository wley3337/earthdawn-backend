        """The Orbiting Spy talent allows a character to summon a spirit to watch over the character and to serve as a lookout. To conjure the spirit, the character rolls his Orbiting Spy dice. The result is the number of hours that the conjuring lasts. The spy spirit hovers over the character at a height ranging from a few feet to 20 yards, traveling in a circular pattern centered on the character. The character determines how high or low the spirit hovers. Conjured spies cannot affect nor be affected by the physical world. Orbiting Spies are immune to most spells, except those which disrupt or dispel magic.
Conjured spy spirits are on constant alert. Whenever the character wants to use the spirit to perceive something, the player makes an Orbiting Spy Test in place of a Perception Test. The spy spirit informs the conjurer character of anything unusual it notices. Many characters using Orbiting Spy give the spirit specific instructions regarding what to look for in order to prevent unpleasant surprises. Spy spirits can see into the astral plane as well as the physical world."""
