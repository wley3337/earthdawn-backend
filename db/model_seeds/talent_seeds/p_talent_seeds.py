        """Characters use the Picking Pockets talent to pick the pockets of likely targets. This talent combines sleight of hand with minor levitation magic. The character can palm coins, cards, and other small objects. The Picking Pockets talent comes in handy for card tricks and for lightening a purse or two. To use Picking Pockets a character makes a Talent Test against the Spell Defense of the target. An Average success means the character successfully picks one pocket (steals one item, and so on), but the target has a chance to notice the act. The target makes a Willpower Test using the result of the Picking Pockets Test as the Difficulty Number. If the test is successful, the target notices that the character picked his pocket. If the character using the talent rolls a Good or better success in the Picking Pockets Test, the character successfully picks one pocket without the victim noticing."""

A character can also make a Poison Resistance Test in place of one Recovery Test. This talent actually removes some of the poison from the character's body. When a character makes a Poison Resistance Test, a few drops of blood seep through his skin, carrying away some of the poison. Reduce the Difficulty Number by -1 for each successive test to resist that same dose of poison."""
