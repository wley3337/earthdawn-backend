        """Versatility is a human racial talent, available to all human characters at First Circle. A human character with ranks in Versatility may learn talents from Disciplines other than his own, paying the same Legend Point costs as would a member of that Discipline to gain those talents. The character must be trained for each talent he learns. A human may learn a number of talents equal to his rank in Versatility. A character cannot learn a talent from a Circle higher than his current Circle. For example, if the character is Third Circle, he can learn talents from other Disciplines available at Third Circle or lower.
The Versatility talent and talents bought with Versatility do not count toward the requirements to advance to a higher Circle. This means that characters who consistently purchase talents from other Disciplines using the Versatility talent will take much longer to advance through the Circles of their own Discipline.
Characters with Versatility may buy ranks in variations of the Thread Weaving Talents. For example, a human Wizard could buy ranks in the Elementalism variation of Thread Weaving.
A character cannot use the Versatility talent to purchase talents available in his own Discipline. This includes talents available to the character at a higher Circle. For example, a First Circle human Archer could not purchase the Melee Weapons talent using Versatility because Archers have access to the Melee Weapons talent at a higher Circle."""
