    "The Abate Curse talent allows a character to temporarily nullify any curses on a weapon so that someone can handle the weapon without suffering the effects of the curse. The character must use Abate Curse on the weapon before touching it, however. The character must be within 3 yards of the weapon to use Abate Curse, and he must remain within that distance while using the talent or the effect ends. To use this talent, make an Abate Curse Test against the weapon's Spell Defense. A successful test temporarily negates the curse. Abate Curse lasts a number of hours equal to the result of the test.

    """Air Sailing is the art of maneuvering the great flying ships used by Sky Raiders. With this talent a character knows how to work the rigging, tiller, or oars of the ships. Any character who wishes to join a crew must have at least Rank 1 Air Sailing Talent. Command ranks require higher ability: a mate must have at least Rank 4, a captain at least Rank 7, and a navigator at least Rank 8. Not all ships have navigators.

Characters use Air Sailing for the rowing that propels airships through the sky. To help row an airship, a character must roll a 4 on an Air Sailing Test. An above-average success will permit the character to take the place of more than one rower: a Good success counts as 2 rowers. An Excellent success means the character can replace 3 rowers. An Extraordinary success counts as 4 rowers.

For a ship to stay airborne, at least one-fourth of its rowers must make successful Air Sailing Tests. If at least half the rowers make successful tests, the ship can maneuver at its current altitude, dive, or climb slowly in a straight line. If three-fourths of the rowers are successful, the ship can speed up, maneuver while climbing, or perform aerobatics. A ship with a rowing crew of 20 needs at least 5 rowers to succeed at Air Sailing Tests in order to stay afloat. This might also be an equivalent number, such as 2 rowers, 1 of whom achieved an Extraordinary success on the Air Sailing Test(thereby replacing 4 rowers)."""

Other Elementalists hear Air Speaking as normal conversation. The range for this talent is the result of the Air Speaking Test x 5 yards; master Elementalists can lecture entire gatherings with Air Speaking.

After the Beastmaster has successfully used this talent one time, the animal takes a neutral attitude ("live and let live") toward him or her. A second successful use makes the animal friendly enough to the character that he will play with the character. The character cannot further attach the animal to him until he improves his Animal Bond talent to at least Rank 4. Once a character has Animal Bond at Rank 4 or more, he can begin to train the animal. When training becomes possible, a successful Animal Bond Test makes the animal loyal to the character as long as the character remains loyal to the animal. The animal willingly takes risks for the character and expects appropriate rewards for doing so. (This is more easily accomplished than for human friends. All a dog really wants is lots of affection and enough food.) A loyal animal will accompany a character on adventures if the character so desires."""

Each command requires a separate, successful use of Animal Training. Each use takes 1 week, during which time the character must treat the animal well.

Any time an opponent attacks a character with the Avoid Blow talent, the attacked individual makes an Avoid Blow Test to dodge the blow before it causes damage. If he rolls a result equal to or higher than that of the opponent's Attack Test, the target avoids the blow. This means that he or she saw the attack coming and dodged out of the way at the last minute. Your character cannot use the Avoid Blow Talent to dodge blind-side attacks, however.

The blow would normally have landed, but Poorht sees it coming and decides to use his Avoid Blow talent. He rolls a 12, just enough for Poorht to dodge and take no damage. """
